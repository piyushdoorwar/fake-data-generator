# Fake Data Generator

Create realistic JSON data by designing a schema on the left and generating records on the right.

## Features
- Schema builder with field types (name, email, phone, address, company, UUID/ULID, numbers, dates, booleans, text, image URLs).
- Flat or nested output (dot notation becomes nested objects).
- Drag to reorder fields.
- Generate up to 1000 records.
- Copy or download generated JSON.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Add fields, choose types, and set options where available.
3. Set the record count (1–1000).
4. JSON updates automatically; use the toolbar to copy or download.

## Notes
- Nested mode uses dot notation (example: `user.email`).
- Field order matches the order shown in the list.
